What is this?
- I am developing this script into an R package. I will be updating the documents and this README.md file as necessary.
- This packages will parse through a .gbk file, which contains gene annotations, and return to you a .csv sheet specifying whether genes are present or absent in the genome based upon a list of genes that you give it.

This README.md file will be updated with more specific details as I complete the package.
